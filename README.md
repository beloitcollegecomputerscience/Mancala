# Mancala User Manual

### Log In
This feature allows for the user to save their high scores
### Objective of the Game
The objective of Mancala is to capture as many stones as possible before the game ends. The player with the greater number of captured stones in his storage cup at the end of the game wins. Stones are captured through the redistribution process (hereafter referred to as sowing) of pieces around the board.
### Starting the Game
On a turn, a player picks up all the seeds in one pit and “sows” them to the right, placing one seed in each of the pits along the way. If you come to your store, then add a seed to your store and continue. You may end up putting seeds in your opponent’s pits along the way. Play alternates back and forth, with opponents picking up the seeds in one of their pits and distributing them one at a time into the pits on the right, beginning in the pit immediately to the right.
### Winning
The process of sowing and capturing continues until one player runs out of stones to sow. When one player is unable to make a move, the game is over, and the player with the greater number of captured stones in his storage cup wins. The game may also end when few enough stones remain in the playing cups to make continued play pointless. Both players can agree to abandon play at that point. The player with the greater number of captured stones in his storage cup wins.
